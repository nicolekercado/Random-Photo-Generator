# Random-Photo-Generator
Built an app that loads random images, from a given url, everytime a button is tapped. The background color also changes to another random color when the button is tapped. 


In the ViewController.swift file, most of the code for the app's functionality was implemented. A image and buttton were created and everytime the button is tapped, the image changes to a randomly selected one and the background color changes to a random color.
